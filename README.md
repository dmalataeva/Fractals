# Story and Canvas

This project is an exploration of web graphics and design. Particular points of focus are user-centric experience,
human interaction with- and interpretation of- art, as well as visually striking storytelling.

This repository will be filled up in the next few months, as I expand my search for interesting ideas and
concepts to implement. :>
