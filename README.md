# Fractals
This repository contains fractals and mathematical phenomena I'm exploring.
Currently, only the Mandelbrot drawing script is available to the public.
Apologies.

### Description: 
The Mandelbrot Set fractal visual representation.
The program draws a Mandelbrot Set fractal basing on the complex plane.
Moreover, basing on how many iterations are made with the complex number, the fractal uses
different colours to draw itself.
